# Replit.md

## Overview

This appears to be a new or empty repository with no existing code structure. The project needs to be built from scratch, and architectural decisions will be made as development progresses.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

No existing architecture has been established yet. As the project develops, this section should be updated to reflect:

- **Frontend Framework**: The chosen UI library/framework (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.)
- **Backend Framework**: Server-side technology (Express, Fastify, Flask, etc.)
- **Data Layer**: Database and ORM choices (Drizzle, Prisma, raw SQL, etc.)
- **API Design**: REST, GraphQL, or other communication patterns
- **Authentication**: User identity and session management approach
- **State Management**: How application state is handled

When making architectural decisions, consider:
1. Project requirements and scale
2. Team familiarity with technologies
3. Long-term maintainability
4. Performance requirements

## External Dependencies

No external dependencies have been configured yet. As integrations are added, document:

- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, SQLite, MongoDB, etc.
- **Authentication Providers**: OAuth providers, Auth0, Clerk, etc.
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe, PayPal, etc.
- **Email Services**: SendGrid, Resend, etc.
- **File Storage**: S3, Cloudflare R2, etc.
- **Third-party APIs**: Any external services the application consumes

For each dependency, note:
- Purpose and use case
- Required environment variables
- Any rate limits or usage constraints
